New features
------------

For a high-level description of the main new features in this release, please consult the homepage of the embedded documentation, available by simply typing `doc` in the Scilab console.

### Scilab 2026.1.0

#### New functions

- `check_help()`: Validate Scilab XML help files against the Scilab Relax NG schema.
- `help()`: Display an inline summary of a documentation page in Scilab console.
- `ishermitian()`: Check whether a matrix is hermitian.
- `issymmetric()`: Check whether a matrix is symmetric.
- `parquetRead()`: Read a Parquet or Arrow file and return a table.
- `parquetWrite()`: Write a table in a Parquet or Arrow file.
- `pdist()`: Pairwise distances between observations.
- `pdist2()`: Pairwise distances between two sets of observations.
- `squareform()`: Conversion between a distance vector and a symmetric distance matrix.
- `summary()`: Summary of `table` or `timeseries` variables (properties, statistics...).
- `xcosDiagramExport()`: Export an Xcos diagram to an image.
- `xlsxInfo()`: Get information about an Excel file.
- `xlsxRead()`: Read data from an Excel file and return a matrix or cell.
- `xlsxSheet()`: Manage sheets in an Excel file.
- `xlsxWrite()`: Write data (matrix or cell) to an Excel file.

#### Features improvements

- New web-based GUIs for ATOMS & Scilab Demonstration using "browser" uicontrols.
- Objects defined using `classdef` now support static properties and methods.
- `csvTextScan()` now manages a "substitute" option as `csvRead()` to enable replacement of particular strings in the read file.
- `dbscan()` now accepts two more input arguments to specify metric distances and parameters.
- `dbscan()`, `kmeans()` and `meanshift()` now use `pdist2()` for better performances.
- `format()` now supports engineering notation (similar to exponential notation but with an exponent value divisible by three).
- `gallery()` can now generate "minij" (Symmetric positive definite matrix) and "moler" (Moler symmetric positive definite matrix) test matrices.
- "use_vectorized" parameter is now available for `optim_ga()`, `optim_moga()`, `optim_nsga()`, `optim_nsga2()` to indicate that the cost function is vectorized (called with the whole population at once).

#### Language evolutions

- Arithmetic operators now perform **automatic expansion** with no memory overhead: a singleton dimension is automatically replicated to match the other operand, making manual expansion (using `.*.` or `repmat()`) unnecessary for most case. See `doc operator_expand`.

### Scilab 2026.0.0

#### New functions

- `cdftnc()`: Cumulative distribution function of the non-central student's T distribution.
- `dbscan()`: Density-based clustering.
- `enumeration()`: Get the enumeration of a classdef or an object.
- `estimate_bandwidth()`: Estimate an appropriate bandwidth for mean shift clustering.
- `gallery()`: Generate test matrices.
- `gradient()`: Compute numerical gradient.
- `isa()`: Check variable type.
- `meanshift()`: Mean shift clustering algorithm.
- `methods()`: Get accessible methods of a classdef or an object.
- `properties()`: Get accessible properties of a classdef or an object.
- `sortrows()` : Sort rows of a vector, matrix, table, or timeseries.
- `spset()`: Set non-zero entries of a sparse matrix.

#### Features improvements

- `host()` has been rewritten and is now used as a backend for all other functions that perform system calls (`dos()`, `unix()`, `unix_g()`, `unix_s()`, `unix_w()`, and `unix_x()`) which are now obsolete.
- `intersect()` now manages `duration`, `datetime`, `table`, and `timeseries` types.
- `lib()` can now load a library without exposing its symbols (default behavior remains unchanged).
- `setdiff()` now manages `duration`, `datetime`, `table`, and `timeseries` types.
- `table()` and `timeseries()` now manage integers.
- `union()` now manages `duration`, `datetime`, `table`, and `timeseries` types.
- Options names are now case-insensitive for `duration()`, `calendarDuration()`, `datetime()`, `timeseries()`, and `table()` functions.

#### Language evolutions

- Classes/Objects can now be defined and used in Scilab based on the new `classdef`, `enumeration`, `properties` & `methods` keywords.
- The `end` keyword can now be used to specify the last row/column index of an array, similarly to `$`.

#### Graphics

- Axes handles can now have their own colormap. If not provided, then the parent figure colormap is used (as in previous versions).

#### Xcos

- Diagrams are saved as [SSP](https://ssp-standard.org/) (System Structure and Parametrization) files by default. This setting can be edited in user preferences.
- Users are now enabled to save their diagrams as COSF files.
- COS format is no more associated with Xcos under Windows.
- SSP files are associated with Scilab during installation under Windows.

### Scilab 2026.1.0

- `readtable()` & `readtimeseries()` now also return empty columns (columns with missing or undefined names).

Compilation
-----------

### Scilab 2026.1.0

- Windows ARM64 support added (no official binaries available).
- Under Linux/macOS, installation of documentation (.xml files) was optional before this version (using a dedicated configure option). This option has been removed as .xml files are now mandatory for the `help()` function.

If you are familiar with building Scilab from sources, these dependencies have been updated:

- New dependency: libxslt >= 1.1.35 (used by `help()`).
- New dependency: XLNT >= 1.6.1 (used by `xlsxInfo()`, `xlsxRead()`, `xlsxSheet()` & `xlsxWrite()`).
- New dependency: Apache Arrow 19.0.0 with Parquet format & ZLIB support (used by `parquetRead()` & `parquetWrite()`).

### Scilab 2026.0.0

- Windows: Migration to Intel® oneAPI HPC Toolkit 2025.2.
- Linux: GCC 15 is now supported.

If you are familiar with building Scilab from sources, the following dependencies have been updated.

- Required API version of JCEF updated to 130.1.9 (Scilab is packaged with version 135.0.20).
- PCRE2 10.43 (or more recent) is now required (instead of PCRE1).
- Scilab now uses SUNDIALS 7.4.
- Under Windows, Scilab now uses HDF5 1.14.3 instead of 1.14.4 (see [#17441](https://gitlab.com/scilab/scilab/-/issues/17441)).
